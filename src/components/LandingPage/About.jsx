        <p className="about">Action-oriented web developer seeking to join a team in creating beautifully engineered web applications that make an impact. My career not only spans among the financial and web3 sectors, but also internationally from West to East, with varying experiences along the way. The past few years have spawned, in myself, a ravenous interest in web3 and web development, which subsequently led to a few personally-built practical projects, such as a social DAO app and a full-fledged multi-crypto wallet. On top of that I enjoy writing & podcasting as it helps me contextualize many complicated subjects.</p>
